# **Job Board Website with Resume Maker**

This project is a comprehensive job board platform that allows users to search for job listings, 
apply for positions, and create professional resumes using the built-in resume maker. 
The goal is to streamline the job application process and provide job seekers with the necessary tools to build their careers.

The platform automatically generates resumes for users once they create an account and allows them to choose a template,
making the process more convenient for those who do not have a resume yet.

In addition to the resume maker, the platform also offers video chat functionality, enabling users to directly engage with potential employers without the need to switch to another platform. 
This feature streamlines communication, providing a seamless experience from job search to interview. Whether it's for an initial conversation, a follow-up interview, 
or ongoing discussions, video chatting makes the platform a one-stop solution for all job-seeking needs.
