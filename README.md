# **Job Board Website with Resume Maker**

This project is a comprehensive job board platform that allows users to search for job listings, 
apply for positions, and create professional resumes using the built-in resume maker. 
The goal is to streamline the job application process and provide job seekers with the necessary tools to build their careers.

The platform automatically generates resumes for users once they create an account and allows them to choose a template,
making the process more convenient for those who do not have a resume yet.
